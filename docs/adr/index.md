# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

Documenting important architectural decisions and their context.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are documents that capture important architectural decisions made along with their context and consequences.

## ADR Format

Each ADR should include:

- **Status** - Proposed, Accepted, Rejected, Deprecated
- **Context** - The issue motivating this decision
- **Decision** - The change that we're proposing or have agreed to implement
- **Consequences** - What becomes easier or more difficult to do

## ADR Template
