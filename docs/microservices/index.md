# Microservices

Microservices architecture patterns and best practices.

## Overview

This section covers microservices architecture, service design, communication patterns, and operational concerns.

## Topics

- Service decomposition
- Service communication
- API gateway patterns
- Service mesh
- Distributed tracing
- Service discovery

## Key Concepts

### Service Boundaries

How to identify and define service boundaries.

### Communication Patterns

- Synchronous (REST, gRPC)
- Asynchronous (Message queues, Events)

### Data Management

- Database per service
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions
- Event-driven data synchronization

## Challenges

- Service coordination
- Distributed transactions
- Network latency
- Service versioning
- Testing distributed systems

## Patterns

- **API Gateway** - Single entry point
- **Service Mesh** - Infrastructure layer
- **Circuit Breaker** - Fault tolerance
- **Bulkhead** - Isolate failures
